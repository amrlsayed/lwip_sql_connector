# LWIP MySQL connector
This is an ongoing  project for a lwip mySQL connector based on TCP RAW API.<br>
The seed for this project was an Arduino based mySQL connector called ["MySQL_Connector_Arduino"](https://github.com/ChuckBell/MySQL_Connector_Arduino) by [ChuckBell](https://github.com/ChuckBell/).

Currently implemented functions are INSERT and SELECT. We are working on testing and implementing more mysql functions. the connector is tested with mysql version 5.5 and also with xampp which uses mariadb version 10.1.19 which a fork of mysql.
Using the examples on the examples folder you can test all functions including connect,insert and select.
